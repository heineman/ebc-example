Take a shot at implementing your own implementation of the Bowling Game exercise.

The original Coding Dojo is limited -- it only requires the total score for the game.  My example is more complicated by requiring scores for intermediate frames, in 
addition to whether strikes/spares occur.

A full solution (in C#) can be found here:

There are lots of other solutions on the Internet.
